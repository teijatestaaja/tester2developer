# Journey from Tester to Developer or Test-Developer

I wanted to start the 2020s by studying new technologies and programming languages in order to change my job from testing into more towards developer, be it test-related or pure developer job.

I am completing these various types of programming-related studies on online courses and tutorials while working full-time as a Senior Test Automation Engineer. I will also study some testing-related stuff to broaden my knowledge at work.

Studying and learning new things is something I enjoy and value a lot, because as a person I am curious and always eager to learn. Due to covid-19, all sports were cancelled in spring 2020 so I started also to learn Portuguese in April with Duolingo App. In 2022 I continued studying Portuguese as my major at the University of Helsinki.

## Completed courses and workshops in 2025

Theme of the year: Study more about [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [Android development](https://developer.android.com/).

## Completed courses and workshops in 2023-2024

Theme of the year: I concentrated on studying Portuguese and Spanish in [Kielten kandiohjelma](https://www.helsinki.fi/fi/koulutusohjelmat/kielten-kandiohjelma) at the University of Helsinki.

## Completed courses and workshops in 2022

Theme of the year: I concentrated on getting into the University of Helsinki to study Portuguese thus I did not complete any IT courses.  In September 2022 I finally started my studies.

## Completed courses and workshops in 2021

Theme of the year: To finish Bachelor of Business Administration degree. In December 2021 I finalized my degree in front-end programming at the Haaga-Helia Applied University.
