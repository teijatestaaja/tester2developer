# Journey from Tester to Developer

I wanted to start the 2020s by studying new technologies and programming languages in order to change my job from testing into more towards developer, be it test-related or pure developer job.

I am completing these various types of programming-related studies while working full-time as a Senior Test Automation Engineer. I will also study some testing-related stuff to broaden my knowledge at work.

Studying and learning new things is something I enjoy and value a lot, because as a person I am curious and always eager to learn. Currently, I have a study right in the Degree Programme in Business Information Technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, where I am continuing my studies in [software engineering](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/index.php/en/13336/en/39079/DIGI19-E/303/year/2019?userLang=en). Once finished, it will be my 5th university degree.

Due to covid-19, all sports were cancelled in spring 2020 so I started also to learn Portuguese in April with Duolingo App.
