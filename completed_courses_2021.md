# Description of completed courses and learnings in 2021

The following is a short description of what I have learned during these courses and workshops.

## Introduction to Kotlin 3 ECTS

This was the first actual online course on Kotlin that I took after starting [my Kotlin self-study project](https://github.com/teijatestaaja/kotlin-self-study). This course covered only the basics of Kotlin and I had studies most of it on my own, so it was more about revising what I had learned before. The course material was really scarce and the tasks were not that great. The course topics included Kotlin data types, variables and operators, arrays, conditional Statements, loops, functions, classes and collections. However, the course also covered areas of debugging in IntelliJ Idea, error handling and file handling, and these subjects I had not studied before on Kotlin so I learned something new as well. Note to self that the next course that I will take on Kotlin must be a little more challenging and advanced.
