# Journey from Tester to Developer

I wanted to start the 2020s by studying new technologies and programming languages in order to change my job from testing into programming. My dream is to work as Full Stack Mobile Developer in the future.

I am completing these various types of studies while working full-time as a Senior Test Engineer. I also have a study right in the Degree Programme in Business Information Technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, where I am studying software engineering.

The following is a short description what I have learned during these courses and workshops.

### RoboCon 2020: Extending Robot Framework (Advanced)

I wanted to learn more about Robot Framework from its creator, so I participated in this workshop during Robocon 2020. This workshop was 100% hands-on, and it was all about learning how to extend Robot Framework using various different interfaces. I had self-learned Robot Framework and I wrote some basic libraries in Python in the summer of 2013.  I was very happy that I participated in this workshop, because during the day I learned a lot more about writing test libraries in Python and also how to modify test suite before executing.

### Kotlin basics

In February 2020 I got and idea to learn a programming language that can be used in Android development. After researching some articles on Internet, I chose Kotlin. I started from zero with Kotlin since I did not have any previous experience related to it before starting this self-study project. So far I have learned how to write a basic todo app in Kotlin, as well as how to write unit tests using JUnit and kotlin's native kotlin.test library.

### IntelliJ for Test Automation Engineers

I used Intelli J IDEA Community Edition for the first time in my Kotlin self-study project. I wanted to learn more about this great IDE, and luckily I found a free IntelliJ course available at TAU. This course taught the most important features that IntelliJ offers. I learned not only how to use the IDE and its menus, but also how to create a Java project and Maven project, how to import existing projects either from a local machine or from a version control repository like Git. I also learned how to run and debug unit tests.
