# Journey from Tester to Developer

I wanted to start the 2020s by studying new technologies and programming languages as well as Portuguese language in order to change my job from testing into programming. My dream is to work as Full Stack Mobile Developer in the future, and learn to speak and write Portuguese fluently.

I am completing these various types of programming-related studies while working full-time as a Senior Test Engineer. I will also study some testing-related stuff to broaden my knowledge at work. As to Portuguese, I have only studied it with the help on an audio CD in my car during driving to trainings, but basically I only know how to say "_hello_", "_good day_" and "_thank you_"!

Studying and learning new things is something I enjoy and value a lot, because as a person I am curious and always eager to learn. Currently, I have a study right in the Degree Programme in Business Information Technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, where I am studying [software engineering](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/index.php/en/13336/en/39079/DIGI19-E/303/year/2019?userLang=en).

The following is a short description of what I have learned during these courses and workshops.

### RoboCon 2020: Extending Robot Framework (Advanced)

I wanted to learn more about [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) from its creator, so I participated in this workshop during Robocon 2020. This workshop was 100% hands-on, and it was all about learning how to extend Robot Framework using various different interfaces. I had self-learned Robot Framework and I wrote some basic libraries in [Python](https://www.python.org/) in the summer of 2013.  I was very happy that I participated in this workshop, because during the day I learned a lot more about writing test libraries in Python and also how to modify test suite before executing.

### Kotlin Basics

In February 2020 I got and idea to learn a programming language that can be used in Android development. After researching some articles on Internet, I chose [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). I started from zero with Kotlin since I did not have any previous experience related to it before starting this self-study project. So far I have learned how to write a basic todo app in Kotlin, as well as how to write unit tests using [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit4/) and kotlin's native kotlin.test library.

### IntelliJ for Test Automation Engineers

I used [Intelli J IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) for the first time in my Kotlin self-study project. I wanted to learn more about this great IDE, and luckily I found a free IntelliJ course available at TAU. This course taught the most important features that IntelliJ offers. I learned not only how to use the IDE and its menus, but also how to create a Java project and Maven project, how to import existing projects either from a local machine or from a version control repository like [Git](https://git-scm.com/). I also learned how to run and debug unit tests.

### Introduction to Programming 5 ECTS, MOOC (Java)

I decided to refresh my [Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) programming skills, since it was around 10 years ago that I last time programmed in Java at work. I had used JavaScript and Python for Test Automation at work, but I had not touched Java even in my free-time. So this free MOOC was perfect for the purposes: to get some Java programming routine, revise the use of collections and how to read and write to a file. So very basic stuff. This course is 5 study points which means workload of 135 hours. However, I completed the course along with 2 hour exam in about 27 hours between January and the beginning of March. This course also supported nicely my Kotlin self-study project.

### Codeless Test Automation with Selenium IDE

At work, I needed to study [Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/) for my next project. Previously I have only used [Selenium Library](https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html) with Robot Framework, but I had not used any kind of codeless test automation tools. After searching the Web I found [official tutorial](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/docs/en/introduction/getting-started) and this TAU course taught by Dave Haeffner, one of current the developers of Selenium IDE. So, this course introduced a free and open source record and playback tool called Selenium IDE. It was a great course for learning basic usage of Selenium IDE, and I learned how to write, run and debug tests with it in addition to writing scripts within the editor. I strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject!

### Vue.js - Arvostele kissakuvia

I am really exited about this [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) workshop. I know JavaScript, but Vue.js is a totally new library to me.
