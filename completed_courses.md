# Description of completed courses and learnings in 2020

The following is a short description of what I have learned during these courses and workshops.

## Extending Robot Framework (Advanced)

I wanted to learn more about [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) from its creator, so I participated in this workshop during Robocon 2020. This workshop was 100% hands-on, and it was all about learning how to extend Robot Framework using various different interfaces. I had self-learned Robot Framework and I wrote some basic libraries in [Python](https://www.python.org/) in the summer of 2013.  I was very happy that I participated in this workshop, because during the day I learned a lot more about writing test libraries in Python and also how to modify test suite before executing.

## Kotlin Basics

In February 2020 I got and idea to learn a programming language that can be used in Android development. After researching some articles on Internet, I chose [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). I started from zero with Kotlin since I did not have any previous experience related to it before starting this self-study project. So far I have learned how to write a basic todo app in Kotlin, as well as how to write unit tests using [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit4/) and kotlin's native kotlin.test library.

## IntelliJ for Test Automation Engineers

I used [Intelli J IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) for the first time in my Kotlin self-study project. I wanted to learn more about this great IDE, and luckily I found a free IntelliJ course available at TAU. This course taught the most important features that IntelliJ offers. I learned not only how to use the IDE and its menus, but also how to create a Java project and Maven project, how to import existing projects either from a local machine or from a version control repository like [Git](https://git-scm.com/). I also learned how to run and debug unit tests.

## Introduction to Programming 5 ECTS, MOOC (Java)

I decided to refresh my [Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) programming skills, since it was around 10 years ago that I last time programmed in Java at work. I had used JavaScript and Python for Test Automation at work, but I had not touched Java even in my free-time. So this free MOOC was perfect for the purposes: to get some Java programming routine, revise the use of collections and how to read and write to a file. So very basic stuff. This course is 5 study points which means workload of 135 hours. However, I completed the course along with 2 hour exam in about 27 hours between January and the beginning of March. This course also supported nicely my Kotlin self-study project.

## Codeless Test Automation with Selenium IDE

At work, I needed to study [Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/) for my next project. Previously I have only used [Selenium Library](https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html) with Robot Framework, but I had not used any kind of codeless test automation tools. After searching the Web I found [official tutorial](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/docs/en/introduction/getting-started) and this TAU course taught by Dave Haeffner, one of current the developers of Selenium IDE. So, this course introduced a free and open source record and playback tool called Selenium IDE. It was a great course for learning basic usage of Selenium IDE, and I learned how to write, run and debug tests with it in addition to writing scripts within the editor. I strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject!

## Azure fundamentals

I needed a small introductory course on Azure, so I decided to go through Microsoft's material on Azure fundamentals, while I was taking a self-study course on Metropolia Applied University. I learned what is Azure and what are required to start developing applicationg on the Azure cloud.

## Advanced Course in Programming 5 ECTS, MOOC (Java)

This was the second part of massive online programming course offered by University of Helsinki. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Finland I had plenty of time to study, since all work was done remotely and all hobbies were cancelled. This course was a bit more challenging, but in the end I spent only 43 hours for completing the tasks and exams. I learned to use Java's ArrayLists and HashMaps fluently.

## Mobile programming 5 ECTS

On this last course before summer holidays, I studied the development of mobile applications with React Native. I learned the basics of React Native, that is how to write a simple React program that uses navigation, networking, location, mapview and sqlite as a database. On the course the following tools were used: Git, Node.js and Expo CLI. The app was tested in a real mobile phone with Expo Client. I really liked this course and I learned a lot about developing mobile applications with React Native.

## Python programming 3 ECTS

This was actually the first official course on Python that I have ever taken. I had self-studied the basics of Python already during the summer of 2013 at work while developing test automation with Robot Framework. So this course was rather easy. It covered the fundamentals of Python language (inline commenting, variables, naming conventions, strings, escaping characters, type conversions, slicing strings, string methods); conditional structure (if-elif-else, logical expression and Boolean values, source code execution order); iteration and iterative structures (while, for, range, break, continue, pass); external files in Python (handling and closing files, different file modes, writing to a file); functions and sub functions (parameters, return value. default values, global variables, lambda functions); modules (Python standard module library, creating your own module); catching exceptions (exception handling, try-except, error classes, try-finally); advanced data structures (list, dictionary, tuple, set, the pickle module, opening files to a bit-writing mode, dumping dynamic structure to a file as a datagram) and object-oriented programming and Python (creating a class, class initialization, class inheritance, introduction to design patterns).

## Selenium WebDriver with Java

I took this course because I had to use the same technologies at work. This course was really well designed introductory course to using Selenium WebDriver with Java. I learned how to install Selenium WebDriver and the other dependencies needed, how to use the WebDriver API to launch and interact with websites and how to integrate the WebDriver API with a test assertion library TestNG. I also learned various techniques to find elements such as buttons, links, text or dropdowns within a web application, and how to organize test code using the Page Object Model.

## ICT architectures

This course was compulsory for the Degree Programme in Business Information Technology. In this course I earned the basics of enterprise architectures, and how to develop it, as well as frameworks such as TOGAF, Kartturi and JHS 179. I also learned how to use the ArchiMate tool for modelling enterprise architectures.

## Python for Test Automation

This was a short introductory course to Python for software testing. This course is very useful for those who already know how to program on one language and want to quickly learn Python for test automation purposes. I already knew the basics of Python that this course introduced, but I also learned new stuff on ways to do multiple inheritance in Python.

## Continuous Integration with Jenkins

Learning about Jenkins has been on my todo list for a long time. I needed to use it at work in a project, this course provided a perfect opportunity to learn about the subject. I learned how to create, configure, and execute jobs in Jenkins, including automated test execution. I also learned about post-build actions such as reporting and sending emails.

## Front end development
