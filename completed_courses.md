# Description of completed courses and learnings starting from January 2020

The following is a short description of what I have learned during these courses and workshops.

## Extending Robot Framework (Advanced)

I wanted to learn more about [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) from its creator, so I participated in this workshop during Robocon 2020. This workshop was 100% hands-on, and it was all about learning how to extend Robot Framework using various different interfaces. I had self-learned Robot Framework and I wrote some basic libraries in [Python](https://www.python.org/) in the summer of 2013.  I was very happy that I participated in this workshop, because during the day I learned a lot more about writing test libraries in Python and also how to modify test suite before executing.

## Kotlin Basics

In February 2020 I got and idea to learn a programming language that can be used in Android development. After researching some articles on Internet, I chose [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). I started from zero with Kotlin since I did not have any previous experience related to it before starting this self-study project. So far I have learned how to write a basic todo app in Kotlin, as well as how to write unit tests using [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit4/) and kotlin's native kotlin.test library.

## IntelliJ for Test Automation Engineers

I used [Intelli J IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) for the first time in my Kotlin self-study project. I wanted to learn more about this great IDE, and luckily I found a free IntelliJ course available at TAU. This course taught the most important features that IntelliJ offers. I learned not only how to use the IDE and its menus, but also how to create a Java project and Maven project, how to import existing projects either from a local machine or from a version control repository like [Git](https://git-scm.com/). I also learned how to run and debug unit tests.

## Introduction to Programming 5 ECTS, MOOC (Java)

I decided to refresh my [Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) programming skills, since it was around 10 years ago that I last time programmed in Java at work. I had used JavaScript and Python for Test Automation at work, but I had not touched Java even in my free-time. So this free MOOC was perfect for the purposes: to get some Java programming routine, revise the use of collections and how to read and write to a file. So very basic stuff. This course is 5 study points which means workload of 135 hours. However, I completed the course along with 2 hour exam in about 27 hours between January and the beginning of March. This course also supported nicely my Kotlin self-study project.

## Codeless Test Automation with Selenium IDE

At work, I needed to study [Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/) for my next project. Previously I have only used [Selenium Library](https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html) with Robot Framework, but I had not used any kind of codeless test automation tools. After searching the Web I found [official tutorial](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/docs/en/introduction/getting-started) and this TAU course taught by Dave Haeffner, one of current the developers of Selenium IDE. So, this course introduced a free and open source record and playback tool called Selenium IDE. It was a great course for learning basic usage of Selenium IDE, and I learned how to write, run and debug tests with it in addition to writing scripts within the editor. I strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject!

## Vue.js - Cat Rating App

I was really exited about this [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) workshop. I know JavaScript and React, but Vue.js is a totally new library to me. In this short workshop, I learned to install Vue Devtools for a browser and install vue with npm. I learned the basics and core principles of Vue.js and how to create a simple Vue project.  To me, Vue seemed at first a bit complicated compared to React, so more studying would be required in the future on this. Unfortunately, this workshop was held just before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Finland and most of the learnings were forgotten since I did not have time to go back to the demo project.

## Azure fundamentals

I needed a small introductory course on Azure, so I decided to go through Microsoft's material on Azure fundamentals, while I was taking a self-study course on Metropolia Applied University. I learned what is Azure and what are required to start developing applicationg on the Azure cloud.

## Advanced Course in Programming 5 ECTS, MOOC (Java)

This was the second part of massive online programming course offered by University of Helsinki. This was a bit more challenging, but in the end I spent only 43 hours for completing the tasks and exams. I learned to use Java's ArrayLists and HashMaps fluently.

## Mobile programming 5 ECTS
