# Journey from Tester to Developer

I wanted to start the 2020s by studying new technologies and programming languages in order to change my job from testing into programming. My dream is to work as a full stack mobile developer in the future.

I am completing these various types of studies while working full-time as a Senior Test Engineer. I also have study right in the Degree Programme in Business Information Technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, where I am studying software engineering.
