# Journey from Tester to Developer or Test-Developer

I wanted to start the 2020s by studying new technologies and programming languages in order to change my job from testing into more towards developer, be it test-related or pure developer job.

I am completing these various types of programming-related studies while working full-time as a Senior Test Automation Engineer. I will also study some testing-related stuff to broaden my knowledge at work.

Studying and learning new things is something I enjoy and value a lot, because as a person I am curious and always eager to learn. Due to covid-19, all sports were cancelled in spring 2020 so I started also to learn Portuguese in April with Duolingo App. In 2022 I continued studying Portuguese as my major at the University of Helsinki.
